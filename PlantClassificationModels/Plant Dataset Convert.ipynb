Although, a popular meat substitute, the flesh of the jackfruit doesn’t contribute the same amount of protein, so for this reason it’s a good idea to combine it with other plant-based sources of protein such as beans, pulses, nuts and seeds. Jackfruit has relatively low calorie count and is richer in micronutrients than many other popular fruits.

Once you do, it will take time to separate the fleshy bulbs you can eat from tough strips of membrane, which you can't. You'll then have to remove the seeds from each bulb. You may prefer to eat jackfruit before it's fully ripe and the rind starts to smell like spoiled onions. If you cut it into chunks and boil them in salted water until they're tender, you can easily slice the meaty flesh from the rind. You can roast or boil the seeds like chestnuts. On the other hand, jackfruit’s seeds and flesh may be boiled and eaten in dishes like curries; when fully ripened the fruit can be enjoyed raw and used in both sweet and savoury dishes.\",\n",

You may prefer to eat jackfruit before it's fully ripe and the rind starts to smell like spoiled onions. If you cut it into chunks and boil them in salted water until they're tender, you can easily slice the meaty flesh from the rind. You can roast or boil the seeds like chestnuts. On the other hand, jackfruit’s seeds and flesh may be boiled and eaten in dishes like curries; when fully ripened the fruit can be enjoyed raw and used in both sweet and savoury dishes.\",\n",
