{"Jackfruit": {"Short Info": "Jackfruit, also known as Artocarpus Heterophyllus by scientific name, is a tropical fruit that grows in Asia, Africa, and South America.", "Scientifc Name": "Artocarpus Heterophyllus", "Benefits": "Jackfruit is known to be the largest edible fruit in the world. With a subtle sweetness, the popularity of jackfruit is partly because of its stringy flesh, the texture of which makes it a great meat substitute in vegan versions of classic recipes like pulled pork or chicken. Although, a popular meat substitute, the flesh of the jackfruit doesn't contribute the same amount of protein, so for this reason it's a good idea to combine it with other plant-based sources of protein such as beans, pulses, nuts and seeds. Jackfruit has relatively low calorie count and is richer in micronutrients than many other popular fruits. Its seeds and flesh contain more calcium and iron than other tropical fruits and is a useful source of B vitamins including B1, B3, B6 and folate.", "Cure": "Jackfruit is a useful source of a wide variety of phytonutrients, these plant compounds are protective and may help prevent the development of certain chronic diseases, such as diabetes. They include vitamin C, carotenoids as well as polyphenols and flavonoids. It also contains heart-friendly nutrients including potassium and fibre. It's this gut-friendly fibre content along-with vitamin C and beta-carotene that suggests jackfruit may be useful for supporting immune health and potentially reduce the risk of viral infection. Moreover, a compound found in the seed of the fruit appears to activate key immune cells, called neutrophils. These immune cells are one of our first lines of defense, they boost the response of other immune cells and also initiate and mediate the inflammatory process. Phytonutrients in the leaves of the plant also appear to improve glucose tolerance in both those with normal blood sugar control as well as people with diabetes. Its nutrients can be used to lower the risk of some health issues such as constipation, ulcers, diabetes, high blood pressure, skin problems, and cancer.", "Usage": "Jackfruit isn't easy to peel because of its sticky sap. To keep it from gumming up your knife and hands, rub them with cooking oil before you slice open your fruit. Once you do, it will take time to separate the fleshy bulbs you can eat from tough strips of membrane, which you can't. You'll then have to remove the seeds from each bulb. You may prefer to eat jackfruit before it's fully ripe and the rind starts to smell like spoiled onions. If you cut it into chunks and boil them in salted water until they're tender, you can easily slice the meaty flesh from the rind. You can roast or boil the seeds like chestnuts. On the other hand, jackfruit's seeds and flesh may be boiled and eaten in dishes like curries; when fully ripened the fruit can be enjoyed raw and used in both sweet and savoury dishes.", "Sources": ["[1] Torrens, K.
